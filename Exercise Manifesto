Hey Peter,

Here is http://exercism.io/ language resources.

And here is the informal exercise list. It technically hasn't been published or revised but take a look and see what you can do.

This was put together by Alex Irvine and Scott Rogers and is by no means definitive or even complete.

If you'd like to research a few more things I'd look at speaking to them both and finding out what they would recommend
- I'd also look at sharing you're github profile so folks can take a look at and review your work.

Cheers,


The TradeMe website provides a wealth of functionality in a web interface and accessible API that most people are familiar with as users.
This provides an excellent technical context for initiating, training and trialing Test Engineers.
The following tasks outlined provide a simple extensible training framework.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 1 - Find me a car!

Objective:

Using the TradeMe web interface, find me the 'best' [Audi] [RS4].
This interface provides a 'soft target' with many buttons, lists and edit boxes to interact with.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 2 - Extend the example

Objective:

A working script has been developed and demonstrated in Task 1. Add a specification to the scenario.
I like to specify the colour. TradeMe doesn't provide a filter for colour, and using it in the Keyword search doesn't always work.
Some careful thinking and a lot of code may be required! Where is colour reliably presented in the listing?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 3 - Now radically change it

Objective:

Change the car from an Audi RS4 to a Toyota Hiace!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 4 - Change the browser

Objective:

Repeat Task 2, with a different browser

Watch out for:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 5 - Change the tool

Objective:

Repeat Tasks 2 and 5, with a different tool.
[Ideas: Selenium, UFT, UFT Pro, WATIR/Rails, Python, Powershell, soapUI]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 6 - Off with its head!

Objective:

Repeat Tasks 2 and 5, but this time use a non-GUI approach.
TradeMe API, soapUI, powershell, curl...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 7 - On the go

Objective:

Repeat Tasks 2 and 5, but this time use the TradeMe mobile app

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Task 8 - Lrn2Read

Objective:

Can you comprehend someone elses (uncommented) code?
